# New feature implementations to the XV6 operating system

Each subfolder within the repository contains a new clone of xv6 (https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public) with the following features (described below) implemented.  Downloading the code within the subfolder and executing ```make``` on Linux will compile the code.  User programs to test the implemented functionality have been added to the XV6 shell emulator, and can be executed by starting the shell ```make qemu-nox``` and entering the name of the user program.
